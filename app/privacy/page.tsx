        <p>
          If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can recognize
          and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.
        </p>
        <p>
          For users that register on our website (if any), we also store the personal information they provide in their
          user profile. All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except they cannot
          change their username). Website administrators can also see and edit that information.
        </p>
        <h2>Data</h2>
        <p>
          If you have an account on this site, or have left comments, you can request to receive an exported file of the
          personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also request that we
          erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for
          administrative, legal, or security purposes.
