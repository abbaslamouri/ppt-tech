        <h2>LED Product Limited Warranty</h2>
        <p>
          PPF Tech will cover defects in LED light source materials and workmanship for a period of 3 years and, for
          products purchased on or after Jan 1, 2022, a limited warranty for an additional 2 years, beginning from the
          date of purchase. PPF Tech warrants that all LED grow lighting products are new and in best working condition.
          The determination of whether the product is defective shall be made by PPF Tech. PPF Tech products will not be
          considered defective under this warranty solely because a small number of separate LED components fail to
          operate when the number of such failed components is less than 10% of the total number of light-emitting
          components which are part of the product. A dated receipt or invoice is required for all warranty claims.
        </p>
        <p>
          Warranties are extended to the original purchaser and are not transferred when reselling products and/or
          facilities including these products.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the fourth and fifth years of the warranty period, PPF Tech, at its sole discretion, may elect to replace
          defective fixtures with refurbished fixtures and shipping cost will be equally shared by the two parties.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beginning from the date of delivery for a period of 90 days, all LED grow lighting products will not be less
          than 15% below light output specifications (initial values tested at 240V before delivery) based on the total
          photon flux (Î¼mol/s of 280-800nm radiation output). Furthermore, if the Product is found, by a certified
          independent third party integrating sphere measurement to be less than 15% below product specifications
          (initial values tested at 230V before the delivery), PPF Tech shall either replace, refund or add additional
          lighting (to make up for the light output deficit) at no charge.
        </p>

          parts and may not be transferred or assigned by the purchaser.
        </p>
