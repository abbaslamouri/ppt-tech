PPF Tech warrants that all LED grow lighting products are new and in best working condition. The determination of whether the product is defective shall be made by PPF Tech. PPF Tech products will not be considered defective under this warranty solely because a small number of separate LED components fail to operate when the number of such failed components is less than 10% of the total number of light-emitting components which are part of the product. A dated receipt or invoice is required for all warranty claims.",

Furthermore, if the Product is found, by a certified independent third party integrating sphere measurement to be less than 15% below product specifications (initial values tested at 230V before the delivery), PPF Tech shall either replace, refund or add additional lighting (to make up for the light output deficit) at no charge."
